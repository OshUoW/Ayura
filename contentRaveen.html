          <h3>Why people should use Ayurvedic products</h3>
          <p>

          <h3>What is the difference between Ayurvedic and Western Medicine</h3>
          <p>
            Understanding how Ayurveda differs from Western medicine is crucial for embracing its potential as a complementary approach to health. 
            Western medicine is undeniably powerful for  diagnosing diseases, treating acute conditions, and performing life-saving interventions.  
            However, its focus on treating symptoms often overlooks the underlying imbalances causing ailments. Ayurveda takes a broader view,  seeing the body, mind, and spirit as interconnected. 
            Treatments focus on restoring balance through a combination of herbs, dietary modifications, lifestyle practices, and even spiritual guidance,  addressing the root cause of disease and promoting overall wellness.
